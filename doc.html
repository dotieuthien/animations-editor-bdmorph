            <h1> Getting started </h1>

            You start by creating new video project from some form of existing data.
            You can start with existing planar mesh (in usual OBJ format) or from an picture.
            in later case you will be be asked to draw the outline of object you want to animate. <br/>
            Currently only one subject is supported, but in future versions you could use an picture that has more that one subject<br/><br/>

            <img src="tutorial/pic1.png" width="50%"/>
            <br/>

            Its also possible to create an new outline from scratch by doing File->Create model <br/></br>


            <h1>Outline Editor</h1></br>

            The editor is pretty basic so far, but good enough for the task. </br>
            To start left click on place where you want to put first vertex and it will became selected (green)</br>
            Everytime you click again, new edge will from from green vertex to new vertex.
            An other vertex can be selected by clicking it.

            <br/><br/>

            <video width="70%" controls>
            <source src="tutorial/tut1.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
            </video> <br/>


            The <i>Create Mesh button</i> invokes code from <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html">Triangle</a>, 
            a library that creates De-Launchy triangiliation of the polygon you had drawn.<br/>
            You can use <i>Mesh Density </i> button to control the density of the resulting mesh
            Default density is OK in most cases, and high density doesn't contribute to quality, but rather slows things down
            It included mostly as a streess tesing measure.
            <br/><br/>

            <h1> The Main screen </h1> </br>

            Here you can apply deformations to to mesh in very similiar way as in original KVF project.
            First you pin the vertexes which you want rougly not move and then drag the one that you think will give you
            the right deformation.
            Adding/removing pins is done either when <b>Pin mode is selected</b> or when you hold <i>Shift</i> while clicking.
            </br>
