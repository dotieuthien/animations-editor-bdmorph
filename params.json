{"name":"Animations-editor-bdmorph","tagline":"Animations editor I implemented during university project","body":"\r\nThis is implementation of paper\r\n\"Planar Shape Interpolation with Bounded Distortion\"\r\nhttp://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~renjie/papers/bdmorph.pdf\r\n\r\nThe code is based on earlier project, implementing the following paper:\r\n \"As-Killing-As-Possible Vector Fields for Planar Deformation\"\r\nhttp://www.stanford.edu/~justso1/assets/kvf_deformation.pdf\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~cggc/Upload/Projects/KVFDeformation/index.html\r\n\r\n\r\nSupported platforms: Linux,Mac,Windows \r\n(+theoretically whatever CMake and Qt supports)\r\n\r\nTo compile you need Qt4,Cmake, ffmpeg libaries (for video output) and \r\nsuitesparse libraries (for matrix solving)\r\n\r\nOn linux you rougly need these packages:\r\n\r\ncmake libqt4-dev libqt4-dev-bin\r\nlibsuitesparse-metis-dev\r\nlibavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev\r\n\r\n(Exact names will vary from distribution to distribution)\r\n\r\nOn windows and/or OSX you need somehow to obtain these libraries, install Qt4,Cmake,\r\nand edit the CMakefiles.txt to reflect their locations\r\nCompilation on Windows tested under Visual Studio 2008\r\n\r\nPersonally I advice you that if you are using Windows, to get a real OS, like\r\nLinux or at least OSX.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
